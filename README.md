# KGE - Museum
This project was developed for the course of Knowledge Graph Engineering, at Uniersity of Trento in the academic year 2022/2023

## Objective

This project considers a museum as the region in which heterogeneous data about visitors’ profiles and visiting behaviors should be integrated by building a Knowledge Graph (KG).

The related data provide the information about visitors’ profiles and visiting behaviors in a museum, e.g., visitors, parts of the museum, dwell time in different parts of museum, and other visiting behavior information in the museum.

The project aims to create a KG representing museum visitors’ profiles and visiting behaviors. This objective will be achieved through a data integration process that will generate a visiting Knowledge Graph (KG) integrating visitors’ data in a museum from various data sources.

## Purpose 

The resultant KG can organize a sequence of KGs representing visitors’ profiles and visiting behaviors for different parts of the museum. This sequence can be analyzed to guide visitors to the most interesting parts of the museum and also help museum owners improve their services. This purpose can be described, in the form of a museum request, as follow:

*"A service that helps a museum acquire visitors’ profiles and preferences for parts of the museum."* 

## Data Resouces

- Museum visiting data involving the Trient Consulting Group (the data cannot be made available as it is under NDA)
- Additional data found on the Internet

## Reference Schema

Schema.org was used to model:
- Visitor
- Action
- Room
- Floor
- Museum
- Exhibit

## Report 

To have more detailed information about all the procedure to create the KG, you can find out report at https://github.com/martina-arturi/museum-project/blob/main/Documentation/KGE_Museum_Report.pdf
