# Workaround uri uniqueness

These script are used to act directly on the RDF exported from karma.
They try to solve the issue that arised in having the id of each entity not unique w.r.t. to the whole dataset.

As the result is technically still wrong, they weren't used for the final solution, but they could be a good example on how to perform operations directly on RDF files without the use of karma.
